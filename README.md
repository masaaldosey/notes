# notes

I have started to write down notes on the different topics I
am interested in (as a way of quick recall).

These might be more useful to beginners.

Each topic has its own `.md` file. In each one of them, order of notes
is _not_ in order of difficulty, but in reverse chronological order
of how I write them (i.e., latest first).
